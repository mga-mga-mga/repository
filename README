I`ve never worked with React.JS, Play Framework before, but I`m open to everything new, and I liked these technologies. As for Scala - I`ve never worked with that too, but I`ve already spent some valuable time for this task, and I`ve decided to put aside this technology for now. If Scala`s presence
will be the last point in your decision, please inform me about that - I will add Scala to the task as soon as I can :)
